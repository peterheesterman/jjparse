# jjparse

Javascript JSON Parser

  - Simple to read
  - Get better over time
  - Benchmark against rust version when i write that

Parsing will include tokenizing and analyzing. The resulting Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) will be used to format json.

* Need to add number support to both the tokenizer and analyzer?
